                The focus of this report is on the Opening Concert of Musikfest Berlin back in 2013, where the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra played pieces of music that will be reviewed below. The 2020-2021 season is this orchestra’s 125th anniversary season. Currently, the orchestra is not holding any concerts due to the global pandemic until March of 2021. However, this orchestra regularly performs at Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center in New York, as well as some major European music cities and festivals such as Musikfest Berlin, BBC Proms, and Beethovenfest Bonn. The conductor of this orchestra is Manfred Honeck. He is an established world leading conductor with international acclaim. In addition, he has won numerous awards including a Grammy Award for Best Orchestral Performance and the title of “Artist of the Year” in 2018 from International Classical Music Awards. Due to his achievements, he’s been honored with numerous honorary doctorate degrees from universities in the United States. This information can be found on the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra website.

                The program starts with Léoš Janácek’s Suite for String Orchestra. This piece has six movements. The first movement starts rather boldly and is known as Moderato. I enjoy the parts where the entire orchestra is involved. It does not sound quite as harsh during those parts. Then, we have the second movement, Adagio, which starts with a contrast to the first movement as it sounds much softer. It seems that this part is violin and viola intensive as I do not hear the bass nor cello for much of the movement, if not the whole movement. The following movement is Andante Con Moto. This movement sounds rather uplifting and it’s a personal favorite due to its mood shifting quality. However, it is rather a short movement. I believe it to be the shortest in length of the movements in this piece. The fourth movement is Presto-Adagio-Presto. This movement starts with a faster tempo and I find it rather interesting. It grabs the audience’s attention. Then, it slows down in the middle, before ending with a faster tempo part. The fifth movement, known as Adagio, starts with cello and bass. Other instruments then join in. The movement ends with the strings being plucked on the cello. The sixth and last movement of the piece is known as Andante. This movement sounds different since the orchestra does not seem to be playing in unison. The texture and sound is more varied. There is also a noticeable tempo change.

                The following piece is Richard Strauss’ Ein Heldeleben, otherwise known as A Hero’s Life. When I looked up the piece, there were six movements. However, I noticed five of the movements when I was listening to the program. It is noted that later versions of the piece may not have the same titles as the composer may have them removed. The five movements are as follows: <br>
                “Der Held” (The Hero)<br>
                “Des Helden Widersacher” (The Hero's Adversaries/Antagonists)<br>
                “Des Helden Gefährtin” (The Hero's Companion/Helpmate)<br>
                “Des Helden Walstatt” (The Hero’s Battlefield/The Hero at Battle)<br>
                “Des Helden Friedenswerke” (The Hero's Works of Peace/The Hero’s Mission of Peace)<br>
                The piece is about fifty minutes long and I must admit, it is not my favorite piece. This is the first piece that incorporates the brass and woodwind instruments along with the strings. Of the movements, I believe the third is my favorite. There is the part with the violin and the rest of the orchestra creating a back and forth dialog. Because of this, there is added texture and makes the rather long piece more entertaining.
            </p>
            <p>
                The next piece is Max Reger’s arrangement of  Franz Schubert’s Lied “Allerseelen”. “Allerseelen” or “All Souls’ Day” is another piece by Richard Strauss. When listening to it, there is a calming quality to it. The piece is quite a soothing one. I rather enjoyed it more than its predecessor. However, it is not my favorite. It is rather a short piece, and personally, not the most memorable.

            </p>
            <p>
                The Final Waltz from the Suite of “Der Rosenkavalier” is the last piece and I believe it to be my favorite. This piece is also known as “The Knight of the Rose” or “The Rose-Bearer.” This is another Opera by Richard Strauss. With its overlapping texture, the piece is the most interesting of the bunch. Although like its predecessor, it was a rather short piece, it became my favorite piece. It really grabs the attention of the audience and makes for a good fanale. 
            </p>

                While I believe this concert to be a good one, there were parts I was not particularly fond of. I appreciated the beginning and the end a great deal. The introduction was quite bold and prepped the audience with a string only orchestral piece. This was my second favorite piece with the third movement uplifting the mood and creating a lighter, happier sound. The quality of the orchestra can really be appreciated here. However, with the following piece, A Hero’s Life, I found it hard to sit through at times. I still appreciated movements three and four which had more interesting textures and sounds that made listening to it a bit less tiresome. But the fifty minute, five movement piece, felt a bit too long for my liking. By the end of it, I was ready for something different. Despite my disinterest in parts of the second piece, I believe the last two pieces of the program were well chosen and a good use of organization. If the ordering of the pieces were rearranged, it would be harder to keep the audience’s attention. Therefore, the order of the pieces should be kept the way they are. If I could change something about the program, I may decide to pick a different second piece. Although the piece did fulfill a longer time slot and makes for a more robust program, I personally think I would enjoy the program more with pieces that were shorter but fulfilled the same time slots. There would just be more variety and less reason for audience members like myself to shift their focus. With that being said, I still enjoyed the concert and I would listen to something similar again.
