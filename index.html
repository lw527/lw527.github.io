            <img src = "images/me.jpg">
            <p> Hello! <br> I am a developer passionate about technology and applying technological solutions to everyday problems. As part of my personal growth journey, I continuously strive to learn new things everyday. It was during my undergraduate years when I formally developed an interest in the tech industry, and as a result, began my pursuit of a career in software. Although it is never a bad thing to love to learn, I was quite decidedly torn with which field of science to pursue before university. I was fascinated with Biological Science and Forensic Science. Therefore, I majored in Computer Science, minored in both Forensic Science and Biology, and completed a Cybersecurity Certificate. My fascination with sciences remain, but now, besides coding, I watch Buzzfeed Unsolved and documentaries for fun. I know! What a nerd.

            <p> After completing my degree in January 2021, I decided to take a personal year. The world was a vastly different place before 2020. I graduated in the middle of a pandemic and was really going through it. I spent some much needed time with my family and friends which made the weight of everything tolerable. Now, I am in a much healthier place and I am ready to continue my journey. </p>
