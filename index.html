                I am a developer passionate about technology and applying technological solutions to everyday problems. As part of my personal growth journey, I continuously strive to learn new things everyday. It was during my undergraduate years when I formally developed an interest in the tech industry, and as a result, began my pursuit of a career in software. Although it is never a bad thing to love to learn, I was quite decidedly torn with which field of science to pursue before university. I was fascinated with Biological Science and Forensic Science. Therefore, I majored in Computer Science, minored in both Forensic Science and Biology, and completed a Cybersecurity Certificate. My fascination with sciences remain, but now, besides coding, I watch Buzzfeed Unsolved and documentaries for fun.

                After completing my degree in January 2021, I decided to take a personal year. The world was a vastly different place before 2020. I graduated in the middle of a pandemic and was really going through it. I spent some much needed time with my family and friends which made the weight of everything tolerable. Now, I am in a much healthier place and I am ready to continue my journey.

            <h2> Water Utility Mover App </h2>
            <p> 
                This project was a collaboration between myself and four other team members. We created a web app for consumers to change their water unility service to a new location on a scheduled date. This app was designed using Flask, SQL, Python, and HTML. We used the USPS Address Validator API to verify the addresses the user entered were valid. A validator method was created to verify the user entered a valid future date.

            <h2> Personal Website</h2>
            <p> 
                I created this website as practice and went through many iterations before picking some of my favorite elements from the different variations I created. It is an on-going project that will continue to expand as I gain experience. While in school, I was not exposed to JavaScript nor CSS. Through the development of this website, I was able to learn to implement various methods of responsive web design. As a result of Safari's lack in support of the CSS scroll-behavior property, I incorporated JQuery for smooth scrolling. A sticky chevron button was added to smooth scroll back to the top of the page. 
            </p>

            <h2>Work in Progress</h2>
            <p> 
                I am currently working on mobile compatibility for this website. I previously incorporated support for various browsers and window resizing, but I am noticing scaling issues on mobile devices.

                I am planning to create an app utilizing the Plaid API to fetch information from various financial accounts to personalize my own expense and investment portfolio tracker.

                <p> 
                    1. Develop a way to better organize the spotify library using Spotify's Web API<br>
                    2. Create an iOS app that integrates the camera<br>
                    3. Construct an app that uses Google Maps API
